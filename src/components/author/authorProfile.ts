  bio: `I have two kids, and they are the light of my life. I love spending time with them, reading, and writing.

However, there are also things that I find challenging or frustrating, such as the complexities of the English language.

My love for reading fuels my passion for writing my own stories. After immersing myself in a variety of stories, I often find myself craving something different. This is when I mix it up by experimenting with other genres or narrative styles.

While I'm not the best in English, I'm fortunate to have a best friend who loves the language. She often helps me by reviewing my stories, but I don't expect her to fix everything. I'm committed to improving my writing skills independently.
